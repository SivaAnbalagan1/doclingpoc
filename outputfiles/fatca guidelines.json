WT must request a waiver under this section 8.07 at the time the responsible officer makes the certification described in section 8.03 of this Agreement.  WT's request for such a waiver must be approved by the IRS, and waiver requests are not approved automatically.  If WT's request for a waiver is approved, such approval is only to waive WT's obligations under sections 8.04 and 8.05 of this Agreement, and WT is still required to make the certification described in section 8.03 of this Agreement.  The waiver does not preclude the IRS from requesting information or conducting a correspondence review as described in section 8.08 of this Agreement.  WT must apply for a waiver for each certification period for which a waiver is requested."

No provisions shall be contained in the agreement between WT and the partnership or trust that preclude, and no provisions of this Agreement shall be construed to preclude, the partnership's or trust's joint and several liability for tax, penalties, and interest under chapters 3 and 4 to the extent that underwithholding, penalties, and interest have not been collected from WT and the underwithholding or failure to report amounts correctly on Forms 1042, 1042-S or 8966, is due to the partnership's or trust's failure to properly perform its obligations under its agreement with WT. Nothing in the agreement between WT and the partnership or trust shall be construed to limit the partnership's or trust's requirements under chapter 4 as a certified deemed-compliant FFI, an owner-documented FFI with respect to WT, an NFFE, or an exempt beneficial owner. Further, nothing in the agreement between WT and the partnership or trust shall permit the partnership or trust to assume primary chapters 3 and 4 withholding responsibility."
