Updated Withholding Foreign Partnership Agreement and Withholding Foreign Trust Agreement
Revenue Procedure 2017-21
SECTION 1. PURPOSE
This revenue procedure sets forth the withholding foreign partnership agreement (WP agreement) and withholding foreign trust agreement (WT agreement) entered into under ยง1.1441-5(c)(2)(ii) and (e)(5)(v). In general, the WP and WT agreements allow a foreign partnership or foreign trust to assume the withholding and reporting obligations under chapters 3 and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for certain payments of U.S. source income (such as interest, dividends, and royalties) made to its direct partners, beneficiaries, or owners, and in some cases, persons holding interests in the partnership or trust through one or more foreign intermediaries or flow-through entities (indirect partners). This revenue procedure also provides guidance to foreign partnerships and foreign trusts for how to apply to enter into, or renew, the WP or WT agreement.
The WP agreement and WT agreement provided in Revenue Procedure 2014-47, 2014- 35 I.R.B. 393 (the 2014 WP agreement and 2014 WT agreement), were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016, but on December 30, 2016, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced in Revenue Procedure 2017- 15, 2017-03 I.R.B. 437, that the 2014 WP and WT agreements would be treated as in effect until the updated agreements are issued in January 2017. The WP and WT agreements in this

Section 3 of this revenue procedure describes the scope of this revenue procedure, and section 4 of this revenue procedure highlights changes to the WP and WT agreements. Section 5 of this revenue procedure provides the application procedures for becoming a WP or WT and for renewing a WP or WT agreement.
